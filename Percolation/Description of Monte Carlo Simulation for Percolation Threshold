In this project, I engaged in a challenging and insightful task to estimate the percolation threshold of a system via Monte Carlo simulation. 
This task was part of my continuous effort to deepen my understanding and practical skills in computer science, particularly in algorithm 
implementation and performance analysis.

Key Responsibilities:

- Developed a Percolation Java class to model a percolation system using an n-by-n grid, enabling the identification of percolating systems 
  based on dynamically changing site states.
- Implemented critical methods such as open(), isOpen(), isFull(), and percolates() to manipulate and evaluate the grid's state.
- Created a PercolationStats class to conduct a series of computational experiments, providing statistical insights into the percolation 
  threshold through methods like mean(), stddev(), and confidence interval calculations.
- Utilized StdRandom and StdStats from standard libraries for random number generation and statistical computations, ensuring accurate and 
  efficient processing.
- Conducted unit testing to verify the functionality of each component, adhering to rigorous testing standards.
- Explored and compared the performance of two data structures - QuickFindUF and WeightedQuickUnionUF - to understand their efficiency in 
  different scenarios.

Learning Outcomes:

- Gained proficiency in Java programming and deepened understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- Developed a systematic approach to problem-solving, including the implementation of efficient algorithms and performance optimization.
- Enhanced skills in statistical analysis and the application of Monte Carlo simulation to solve complex problems.
- Acquired practical experience in handling edge cases and ensuring the robustness of software solutions.

Technological Stack:

- Java
- StdLibraries (StdRandom, StdStats, Stopwatch)
- Algorithms (Quick Find, Weighted Quick Union)

This project not only solidified my Java programming skills but also provided a profound insight into the practical application of 
theoretical concepts in computer science. The experience of estimating the percolation threshold through simulation has been 
instrumental in my journey as a CS major.
